# Getting Started with Moodle Programming

## Prerequisites
Moodle is a web application which is built on a variety of technologies. Before working on this project, it will be necessary for you to know each of these technologies to a varying degree.

1. All webpages are rendered in **HTML** _(Hyper Text Markup Language)_. You will most likely not write anything in HTML directly while working on Moodle plugins, but understanding how webpages work is really a prerequisite for any kind of web development. If you are unfamiliar with HTML, Codecademy's [Learn HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html) course should be sufficient to teach you the basics. W3schools has a useful [language reference](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp) should you need to look up something specific.

2. **PHP** is the central language of Moodle, and you will need a solid understanding of the syntax and semantics before continuing. If you already have a Java background, perusing the [PHP Manual](https://secure.php.net/manual/en) might be enough to give you a working sense of the language. In particular, you should read the [introduction](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/introduction.php) and look through the [language reference](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/langref.php). If you want a more thorough understanding and prefer to learn actively rather than from reading language documentation, you should work through Codecademy's [Learn PHP](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-php) course.

3. Moodle uses an **SQL** _(Structured Query Language)_ database to store and manage all of its data. Moodle provides a [Data Manipulation API](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Data_manipulation_API) that allows you to execute simple queries without writing out the SQL. However, this API doesn't handle more complex situations, so you will still need to be familiar with how to construct an SQL query. If you haven't used SQL before, Codecademy's [Learn SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql) is a good introductory resource. You can also consult the [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en), though be wary that Moodle doesn't support all of the features of MySQL in order to support various database options. For example, many of the data types are not supported.

4. **JavaScript** allows webpages to be interactive and change without the browser needing to reload the page. This greatly improves user experience on any web application of reasonable complexity. JavaScript is used on the server-side of Moodle Plugins, but it is used somewhat frequently to make HTML forms and other elements interactive. As such, it is not essential that every individual working on the project have a deep understanding of the language, but you should at least be familiar with it. JavaScript's syntax is similar to that of Java, but it has many important syntactical and semantic differences. Codecademy's [Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) should be more than sufficient to get you up and running. Moodle relies primarily on the JS Library jQuery for all DOM interaction. Codecademy's [Introduction to jQuery](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-jquery) and jQuery's [API documentation](https://api.jquery.com) are both good resources. Moodle plugins define all JavaScript in AMD _(Asynchronous Module Definition)_ modules. See [this MoodleDocs page](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Javascript_Modules) for more information.

5. Rather than writing HTML directly or building up the page within the PHP itself, Moodle uses the templating language **Mustache** to define the HTML which is ultimately served to the user. Because these templates are intrinsically reusable, you won't often need to write new ones. However, if you should need to write something in a Mustache template, the [MoodleDocs page Templates page](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Templates), the [Mustache Manual](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html), and the documentation for the PHP implementation in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/bobthecow/mustache.php) are all good resources.

6. **CSS** _(Cascading Style Sheets)_ is what determines how a webpage is ultimately displayed in the client's browser. Moodle is designed to allow for theme plugins which can change how the site looks dramatically. As such, we don't have to worry much about CSS when writing other types of plugins. There is a small amount of CSS in the repository, but it is not something that will need to change as the project expands. Moodle's current default theme, Boost, is built on Twitter's [Bootstrap API](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/), so if you want to use any Bootstrap elements, all you need to do is add the appropriate class in your mustache file or in the PHP.

Once you feel you have a sufficient grip in these technologies, you are almost ready to start working on our Moodle plugins. Before you begin, you should familiarize yourself with [MoodleDocs](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Main_Page). Moodle's Documentation is incomplete in some areas and not always up to date, but it definitely a useful resource nonetheless. The documentation for this project will frequently reference the MoodleDocs pages of any relevant APIs.
